Catch The Coins will consist of a greedy person and an environment full of bouncing coins. The user will control the person, and their goal is to collect as many coins as possible within the level’s time limit. There will be obstacles like walls and traps that slow the player down. There will also be special coins that are deducted from the number of coins collected.

There will be X number of levels, and the only thing that will change between runs of a level will be the random coin movement.

There will be a leaderboard for each level, and it will consist of the top X times of the user. The game will be able to be signed into through a login screen only asking for the profile name.

There will be functionality to exit a level, pause/resume a level, mute sound, and other appropriate controls for the effects added.

This project is important due to its full-stack approach to building a functional video game that parallels many key features in modern video games. Building this project would help build valuable skills in frontend, and back development and implement software design structures that we have learned so far.  While this can be challenging, it makes it that much more interesting due to the fact that none of us have experience building something of this exact nature, so it will push us to be more creative. It will also give us the opportunity to work on technologies/frameworks that we may not have used before which would also help us become a better developer.

Input: There will be a “user login” page where the user can enter their username. This will open the game and take them to a specified game level, or the level they left with.
The details entered will be cross-referenced with the database to retrieve the level information for the output. If they are a “pro” (finished all the levels), they will be prompted to choose a level they would like to play on another page. Based on this selection, a level will be launched.

Output: Based on the input parameters, and the information that was pulled from the database, a pop-up window will take the user to the level that they left the game, or the level they specify. On the GUI window, we will have the game, a high score for the user, an overall high score, current points, a timer to indicate the time they have left to complete the current level, and the number of tries they have taken. After the game, all of the information received will be displayed, and the leaderboard will also be displayed. After they finish the game, the new data will be entered into the database.

Languages
Python -Used for creating the game itself
SQL - Used for querying and storing user data in the database.

Tools
Python Arcade - The Python library used to code the core game mechanics.
Pytest - Python module for writing unit tests.

Technologies
Git - Used as a version control system for the project.
Pip - Used for installing and managing the project dependencies.
SQLite - A mobile version of MySQL which is used to store the user information.

We are still exploring options to host the game online.

 > ## Phase II
 > In addition to completing the "User Interface Specification" and "Class Diagram" sections below, you will need to:
 > * Create an "Epic" (note) for each feature. Place these epics in the `Product Backlog` column
 > * Complete your first *sprint planning* meeting to plan out the next 7 days of work.
 >   * Break down the "Epics" into smaller actionable user stories (i.e. smaller development tasks). Convert them into issues and assign them to team members. Place these in the `TODO` column (aka Sprint Backlog).
 >   * These cards should represent roughly 7 days worth of development time for your team. Then, once the sprint is over you should be repeating these steps to plan a new sprint, taking you until your second scrum meeting with the reader in phase III.
 > * Each team member needs to submit the Individual Contributions Form on Canvas for this phase. In this form, you need to fill in the names of all team members, the percentage of work contributed by each member for phase  II, and a description of their contributions. Remember that each team member should submit the form individually.
 > * Schedule two check-ins using Calendly. Both time slots should be during your lab on week 6. Your entire team must be present for both check-ins.
 >   * The first check-in needs to be scheduled with your lab TA. During that meeting, you will discuss your project design/class diagram from phase II.
 >   * The second check-in should be scheduled with a reader. During that meeting you will discuss:
 >     * The tasks you are planning for the first sprint
 >     * How work will be divided between the team members
## User Interface Specification
 > Include a navigation diagram for your screens and the layout of each of those screens as desribed below. For all the layouts/diagrams, you can use any tool such as PowerPoint or a drawing program. (Specification requirement is adapted from the User Interface Design Document Template of CMSC 345 at the University of Maryland Global Campus)

### Navigation Diagram
> Draw a diagram illustrating how the user can navigate from one screen to another. Here is an [example](https://creately.com/diagram/example/ikfqudv82/user-navigation-diagram-classic?r=v). It can be useful to label each symbol that represents a screen so that you can reference the screens in the next section or the rest of the document if necessary. Give a brief description of what the diagram represents.

### Screen Layouts
> Include the layout of each of your screens. The layout should describe the screen’s major components such as menus and prompts for user inputs and expected output, or any graphical user interface components if applicable (e.g. buttons, text boxes, etc). Explain what is on the layout, and the purpose of each menu item, button, etc. If many screens share the same layout, start by describing the general layout and then list the screens that will be using that layout and the differences between each of them.

## Class Diagram
 > Include a **class diagram(s)** for your project and a **description** of the diagram(s). Your class diagram(s) should include all the main classes you plan for the project. This should be in sufficient detail that another group could pick up the project this point and successfully complete it. Use proper UML notation (as discussed in the course slides).
 
 > ## Phase III
 > You will need to schedule a check-in for the second scrum meeting with the same reader you had your first scrum meeting with (using Calendly). Your entire team must be present. This meeting will occur on week 8 during lab time.
 
 > BEFORE the meeting you should do the following:
 > * Update your class diagram from Phase II to include any feedback you received from your TA/grader.
 > * Considering the SOLID design principles, reflect back on your class diagram and think about how you can use the SOLID principles to improve your design. You should then update the README.md file by adding the following:
 >   * A new class diagram incorporating your changes after considering the SOLID principles.
 >   * For each update in your class diagram, you must explain in 3-4 sentences:
 >     * What SOLID principle(s) did you apply?
 >     * How did you apply it? i.e. describe the change.
 >     * How did this change help you write better code?
 > * Perform a new sprint plan like you did in Phase II.
 > * Make sure that your README file (and Project board) are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project and the most recent class diagram. Previous versions of the README file should still be visible through your commit history.
>  * Each team member should also submit the Individual Contributions Form on Canvas for phase III. In this form, you need to fill in the names of all team members, the percentage of work contributed by each member for phase III, and a description of their contributions. Remember that each team member should submit the form individually.
 
> During the meeting with your reader you will discuss: 
 > * How effective your last sprint was (each member should talk about what they did)
 > * Any tasks that did not get completed last sprint, and how you took them into consideration for this sprint
 > * Any bugs you've identified and created issues for during the sprint. Do you plan on fixing them in the next sprint or are they lower priority?
 > * What tasks you are planning for this next sprint.

 
 > ## Final deliverable
 > All group members will give a demo to the reader during lab time. ou should schedule your demo on Calendly with the same reader who took your second scrum meeting. The reader will check the demo and the project GitHub repository and ask a few questions to all the team members. 
 > Before the demo, you should do the following:
 > * Complete the sections below (i.e. Screenshots, Installation/Usage, Testing)
 > * Plan one more sprint (that you will not necessarily complete before the end of the quarter). Your In-progress and In-testing columns should be empty (you are not doing more work currently) but your TODO column should have a full sprint plan in it as you have done before. This should include any known bugs (there should be some) or new features you would like to add. These should appear as issues/cards on your Project board.
 > * Make sure your README file and Project board are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project (e.g. any changes that you have made during the project such as changes to your class diagram). Previous versions should still be visible through your commit history.
>  * Each team member should also submit the Individual Contributions Form on Canvas for this final phase. In this form, you need to fill in the names of all team members, the percentage of work contributed by each member for the final phase, and a description of their contributions. Remember that each team member should submit the form individually.
 
 ## Screenshots
 > Screenshots of the input/output after running your application
 ## Installation/Usage
